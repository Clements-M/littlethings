# Programming Exercise: Little Things

I put this together from something I use myself to help make sense of noise. I hope you find it useful.

# General Information

3 steps. Each one builds on the last. By the end you can read a file, find stuff you need, then put it into a human form you can actually use.

```bash
TODO for todos
And you can put text on their own link to add them to the list
```

# Getting it Running

```bash
python littlething.py
```

You'll need python 3.5+, I used anaconda, but you're free to do what suits you. Then look at the html file it generates

# Notes

This is just to show you what you can do with just a little code
